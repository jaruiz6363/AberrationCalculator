# What is verified, and by what

This program computes quantities that are easy to get wrong and hard to check by eye. This
records what has actually been established, by what means, and what has not.

The working log those checks were made in is kept outside this repository, with the author's
notes: it transcribes source material verbatim to reason against, which belongs where the
sources are and not in an MIT-licensed repository. What follows is the standing position
rather than the history of arriving at it.

## The order of evidence

Not every check is worth the same, and they are listed in the order they carry weight.

**1. Buchdahl's own printed numbers.** Paper III works Table I through for a specific
triplet. `BuchdahlPublishedTableTests` reproduces it entry by entry, and his published
totals for the tertiary. This is the oracle, and it is what found the errors in t100–t108.

**2. Closed-form analytic surfaces, which need no other program at all.** A parabolic mirror
images infinity onto its focus with no spherical aberration at any order, so every order must
cancel term for term. A single conic surface can be traced analytically and expanded as
`eps = a3 y^3 + a5 y^5 + a7 y^7 + ...`, giving the third, fifth and seventh orders as numbers.
`ParabolicMirrorTests` and `ExactConicSurfaceTests`. **This is what establishes the aspheric
third and fifth order**, and it had to: nothing else available computes them.

**3. Inverse real ray tracing.** `CoefficientInversion` recovers coefficients from the
landings of real traced rays, by scaling and an odd-polynomial fit. It is this repository's
own code. Eight test files use it as their reference, including every aspheric one.

**4. An independent implementation** of the third and fifth order, written in C++ by this
repository's author directly from the monograph — a different lineage from the same source.
It does not implement aspherics.

**5. Forbes' series trace**, from a separate published paper with no shared code. It agrees
with Buchdahl's scheme on all twenty tertiary coefficients to 2E-13 at both conjugates.

**And a cross-check anyone can repeat.** OpticStudio's Seidel analysis and its FIFTHORD macro
agree with this program — 586 coefficient values across seven designs, worst residual 1.1E-12,
and 30 of 30 third-order values at a finite conjugate. That is recorded because a reader with
OpticStudio can confirm it without trusting anything here. It is not the authority: neither
computes the seventh-order set this program exists for, so neither could be.

## Standing results

| what | result |
|---|---|
| Table I, t1–t155, per surface | matches the reference implementation to 7E-16 |
| the twenty tau, Buchdahl against Forbes | 20 of 20 to 2E-13, both conjugates |
| seventh-order spherical aberration, two routes | identical to every printed digit |
| third order against OpticStudio's Seidel, finite conjugate | 30 of 30 |
| fifth order against FIFTHORD, finite conjugate | 18 of 18 totals |
| the per-surface split | intrinsic + figuring + induced = total, to 1.8E-14 |
| the suite | 552 tests, and everything they read is in this repository |

## What is not established

**The aspheric tertiary arrangement.** Buchdahl gives the aspheric scheme in Sec. 85 of the
monograph but never published the arranged table for it, and that arrangement is the one part
of this subject with no printed answer to check against. This program's version of it
disagrees with Forbes on the small tertiary coefficients of a figured design — tau15 by a
factor of nearly five including its sign, tau20 by half — while the large ones agree to under
one per cent. Use Forbes for figured systems; that is what `zosapi/` exists for.

**A predicted spot cannot settle it, and this is measured rather than assumed.** On that same
design the two routes agree on the spot to one part in ten thousand while disagreeing on the
coefficients as above, because the disagreement sits in the smallest terms and a spot barely
weights them. Predicted-versus-traced spot agreement would have certified a tau15 that is
wrong by five times and points the wrong way. It is not used as a correctness metric here,
and `spot-prediction.md` says what it is used for instead.

**How far the seventh order reaches.** It is a property of the lens and not a number. Of five
designs measured, one is described by third order alone, two need the full seventh to reach a
per cent, one is not well described at seventh, and one is not described at all. See
`spot-prediction.md`.
